So far I have been working with various programming languages, technologies and architectures. I had learned programming with C++ and Java, and have worked in Java, C# and JavaScript production applications.</p>\n<p>Working on both front-end and back-end parts of an application is valuable for me. Having a comprehensive overview of the product helps me deliver quality services.</p>\n<p>Open source software is very important for me. I learn by studying others code and often contribute to open issues.</p>\n<p>I believe that sharing and documenting knowledge is an effective way to give back to the community and this is the concept behind this blog.</p>',timeToRead:1,excerpt:"A little about me I'm Sartios, a 29 year old software developer from Greece.
